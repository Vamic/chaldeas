-- | There are three types of skill effects in the game:
-- | buffs, or positive status effects with a duration;
-- | debuffs, or negative status effects with a duration;
-- | and instant actions like gaining stars or reducing an enemy's NP gauge.
-- |
-- | In CHALDEAS, Buffs are represented by `BuffEffect`s,
-- | debuffs by `DebuffEffect`s, and instant actions by `InstantEffect`s.
-- | This system is also used by passive skills, Noble Phantasm effects,
-- | and Craft Essences.
-- |
-- | For Craft Essences only, there are also `BonusEffect`s that increase gains
-- | of Quartz Points, Bond, and so on.
